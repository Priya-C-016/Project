# Project on Movie Recommendation System using puthon
## Objective
To develop a basic movie recommendation system using Python and Pandas, which utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. This system aims to suggest movies that are most similar to the user's past preferences and behaviors, enhancing the user's movie-watching experience by providing personalized recommendations.

## Explanation
A movie recommendation system predicts user preferences based on past behavior and item characteristics. By employing collaborative filtering, it uses historical user data to find similar user patterns and make predictions. Content-based filtering leverages item attributes to suggest similar movies based on user profiles. The system will be implemented using Python and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, providing tailored movie suggestions.
